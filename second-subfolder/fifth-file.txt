their HT and TALK tokens in exchange for a chance to win part 
of our 1.98 million STF token prize pool!

Rules:

A snapshot of each participant's locked HT and TALK 
balances, as well as the total amount locked, will be
 randomly taken during every 24 hour period for reward 
 calculation purposes. Snapshots will be taken at any 
 time between 8:00:00 on the current day and 07:59:59 on 
 the next day); if the assets are unlocked before the 
 random snapshot time of the day, they will not count 
 towards calculations for rewards. The rewards will be sent
  in STF tokens, and the number of daily rewards is calculated 
  based on the locked HT and TALK tokens of that day; 
  Individual Tiered Coefficient

Reward Calculation:

Individual Daily Reward = Snapshot amount of the user’s 
locked HT or TALK Tiered coefficient) / (Snapshot amount of 
locked HT or TALK Tiered coefficient) of all participants * 
Daily rewards of all participants from locking HT or TALK.

The rewards will be distributed by 13:00, Sept. 16 (UTC) for

will be distributed by 15:00, Sept. 27 (UTC) for users who

will be returned to users’ exchange accounts automatically. 
Before STF trading begins, the rate of return will show as 0 because
